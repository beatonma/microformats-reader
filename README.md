# microformats-reader
A browser extension that brings the Indieweb to the surface!

This extension parses the webpages you visit to find specially tagged data such as h-cards, rel=me links, and webmention endpoints, then displays that content in a consistent format.

Currently supported data:
- Webmention endpoints
- `rel` links: Webmention endpoints, RSS feeds, public keys, etc.
- `h-card`s
- `h-feed`s and `h-entry`s
...and more coming soon!

Hints and tips:
- Hover over any data to view its microformat type.
- `Control` + `right click` any data to copy it to your clipboard.
